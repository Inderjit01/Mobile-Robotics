# Mobile-Robotics
This contains programming projects I have done for my robotics class.

PP1-Localization2D is about applying Markov's localization algorithmn to determine where the robot 
is when it is lost.

PP2-KalmanFilter4D uses Kalman's algorithmn to determine where the robot is when the robot is lost. 

PP3A-CircularMotion is about writing a function in the class robot -move(self, motion) which returns 
an instance of the robot class with the correct coordinates.

PP3B-Sensing is about writing a function in the class robot -sense(self) which returns a list of 
four bearing angles to each of the four different landmarks.

PP3C-Final is about putting the knowledge from PP3A and PP3B together in this file.
